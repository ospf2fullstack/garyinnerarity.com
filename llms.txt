## Enterprise Projects

### Agentic Coder
Multi-tenant, multi-provider agentic coding assistant integrating with enterprise SKILLS repositories. Enables engineers to write, review, and optimize code across languages and frameworks using LLM orchestration.

### Enterprise AI Workflows
Designed and built production-grade agentic systems orchestrating multi-step LLM workflows, custom tools, and specialized agents operating across live enterprise systems.

### Agents, Skills & Tools
Developed composable building blocks for agentic systems — purpose-built agents with defined roles, reusable skills extending agent capabilities, and custom tools giving agents verifiable access to APIs, data, and enterprise services. Includes MCP server development.

### Digital Thread Platform
Designed and built a full-stack platform connecting metadata, artifacts, and cross-system relationships into a continuous data thread — enabling end-to-end traceability across the engineering lifecycle for enterprise decision-making.

### Digital Twin Simulations
Built virtual replicas of physical systems that feed real-time operational data into enterprise decision loops — enabling predictive analysis, scenario modeling, and outcome simulation before committing real-world resources.

### Automated Cyber Compliance
Full-stack design and development of continuous automated compliance pipelines — from policy-as-code through real-time audit dashboards — integrated into the Vertasyn platform.

### Terraform Module Library
Engineered a reusable Terraform module library for multi-cloud deployments (AWS, GCP) standardizing IaC patterns across teams to eliminate configuration drift and accelerate provisioning velocity.

### Monte Carlo Simulator
Developed probabilistic risk analysis tooling using Monte Carlo simulation supporting decision-making for complex engineering and cost estimation scenarios.

### Digital Catalog
Built a digital asset management component ingesting raw BIM, Reality Capture, and 3D modeling outputs and converting them into a structured, queryable catalog.
