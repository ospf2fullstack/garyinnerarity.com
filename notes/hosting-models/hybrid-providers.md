# Hybrid Hosting (Provider Edition)

Hybrid hosting blends on-premises control with cloud elasticity. As a provider, your job is to bridge the two worlds - unifying governance, workloads, and user experience.

---

## 1. Infrastructure Control

- **Unified Fabric**: Consistent networking and identity spanning cloud and on-prem.  
- **Workload Placement**: Run latency-sensitive or regulated apps on-prem; burst capacity in the cloud.  
- **Edge & Gateway Services**: Cloud-managed devices deployed locally (AWS Outposts, Azure Stack, GCP Anthos).

---

## 2. Logging & Observability

- **Cross-Environment Logging**: Centralized aggregation across cloud and on-prem.  
- **Federated Monitoring**: Single-pane dashboards combining multiple telemetry sources.  
- **Data Residency Awareness**: Logs stay in-region or on-prem as compliance dictates.

---

## 3. High Availability & Resilience

- **Split Responsibility**: HA locally (clusters, redundant power) plus cloud replication.  
- **Failover Between Worlds**: Seamless redirect of workloads to cloud if on-prem goes dark.  
- **Global Continuity**: DR strategies spanning both on-prem and multi-cloud footprints.

---

## 4. Security & Compliance

- **Unified Identity & Policy**: SSO, RBAC, and secrets management spanning environments.  
- **Regulated Workloads**: On-prem to satisfy data sovereignty, with cloud services for analytics/AI.  
- **Zero-Trust Edge**: Enforce security across every connection, internal or external.

---

## 5. Customer-Facing Features

- **Consistent Tooling**: Same APIs and IaC templates whether cloud or on-prem.  
- **Migration Paths**: Live workload migration between on-prem and cloud.  
- **Governance Dashboards**: Clear view of costs, usage, and compliance across both worlds.

## 6. Provider Bottom Line

Hybrid isn’t about half-measures - it’s about **choice with consistency**. Providers succeed when customers can **seamlessly extend workloads** between their racks and the hyperscaler’s regions, without reinventing processes each time.
