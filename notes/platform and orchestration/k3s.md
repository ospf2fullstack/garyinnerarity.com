# k3s

A lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for edge, IoT, and resource-constrained environments.  

- **Why it matters**: Easy to install, minimal dependencies, and optimized for single-board computers or low-resource VMs.  
- **Features**:  
  - Fully CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution.  
  - Bundles required components (containerd, flannel, CoreDNS).  
  - Single binary under 100MB.  
- **Use case**: Great for home labs, small clusters, or edge devices where you want Kubernetes power without hyperscaler overhead.

**Keep Reading:** If you're looking at hosting this on edge, do it! If you're interested in hosting it on-prem within a cluster and want to get started, checkout [[proxmox]] as a hypervisor.
