# Core Architectural & Software Needs for Hosting a Web App (non-enterprise)

When hosting a web application, success isn’t just about spinning up a server and hitting deploy. A production-grade setup needs foundational architecture and software practices to ensure stability, security, and scalability.

## 1. Logging & Monitoring

- **Application Logs**: Capture structured logs (JSON if possible) for requests, errors, and business events.  
- **Centralized Logging**: Use tools like ELK/EFK, Datadog, or CloudWatch for aggregation and search.  
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Metrics (CPU, memory, DB latency) plus uptime probes feed into alerting systems (PagerDuty, OpsGenie).

## 2. Reporting & Analytics

- **Operational Reporting**: Health dashboards for performance, error rates, and SLA adherence.  
- **Business Intelligence**: User activity, conversion funnels, and revenue metrics through tools like Looker, PowerBI, or open-source equivalents.  
- **Audit Trails**: For compliance and security, log all access and config changes.

## 3. High Availability & Resilience

- **Redundancy**: Multi-AZ (availability zone) or multi-region deployments to eliminate single points of failure.  
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across nodes (NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer).  
- **Failover & Disaster Recovery**: Automated failover for databases and tested backup/restore procedures.

## 4. Security Essentials

- **Transport Security**: Enforce HTTPS everywhere with TLS termination.  
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access, secrets management, principle of least privilege.  
- **Patch & Update Strategy**: Keep dependencies and runtimes current.

## 5. Redirects & Resource Handling

- **Graceful Redirects**: For legacy URLs, decommissioned endpoints, or downgraded resources, serve redirects instead of 404s.  
- **Static Asset Strategy**: CDN caching, compression, and cache invalidation for faster loads.  
- **Error Handling**: Custom error pages for 4xx/5xx to improve UX and troubleshooting.

## 6. Scalability & Maintainability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Containers and orchestration (Kubernetes, ECS, Nomad) make adding capacity easier.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing, builds, and deployments reduce human error.  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Pulumi, or Ansible for reproducible environments.

**Bottom line:** Hosting a web app is like running a small city - you need governance (logging), census data (reporting), power grids (HA), fire escapes (redirects), and laws (security). Skimp on any of these, and things burn down faster than you can say “outage.”
