# On-Premises Hosting (Provider Edition)

When acting as the provider of on-premises hosting, you’re not just giving customers servers in a rack - you’re delivering a managed ecosystem with enterprise expectations. The core needs shift slightly compared to cloud-only models.

---

## 1. Infrastructure Control

- **Dedicated Hardware**: Customers expect clear resource boundaries — CPU, memory, storage isolation.  
- **Virtualization & Containers**: Support for VMware, Hyper-V, or Kubernetes clusters to balance legacy workloads with modern deployments.  
- **Network Fabric**: Redundant switching, VLAN segmentation, and secure VPN/Direct Connect options.

---

## 2. Logging & Observability

- **Centralized Syslog/Log Aggregation**: Must support customer export or integration with their SIEM.  
- **Performance Monitoring**: Visibility into both physical (disks, power, cooling) and logical layers (VMs, apps).  
- **Service Transparency**: Dashboards showing uptime, maintenance windows, and SLA compliance.

---

## 3. High Availability & Resilience

- **Redundant Power & Cooling**: Tier III or higher data center standards.  
- **Clustered Services**: HA pairs for core services (DBs, load balancers, DNS).  
- **Disaster Recovery**: Offsite replication or optional secondary data center with defined RPO/RTO.

---

## 4. Security & Compliance

- **Physical Security**: Access control, surveillance, and visitor logging.  
- **Tenant Isolation**: Hardened hypervisors and segmentation to prevent cross-customer bleed.  
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, HIPAA) depending on customer vertical.

---

## 5. Customer-Facing Features

- **Self-Service Portals**: VM provisioning, snapshot/restore, and resource reporting.  
- **Redirects & Routing**: Managed DNS and reverse proxy support for clean cutovers.  
- **Custom SLAs**: Tailored uptime, performance, and support tiers.

---

## 6. Provider Bottom Line

As the provider, you’re not just selling “metal” — you’re selling **trust, control, and continuity**. Customers choose on-prem hosting because they need **governance, compliance, or performance guarantees** beyond commodity cloud. Delivering that means you own both the physical and digital stack.
