# Cloud Provider Hosting (Provider Edition)

Cloud providers deliver scalable infrastructure, platform, and managed services that abstract away physical operations. The key responsibilities focus on elasticity, automation, and shared responsibility.

## 1. Infrastructure Control

- **Elastic Compute & Storage**: Auto-scaling VMs, containers, and serverless options.  
- **Global Presence**: Multi-region and multi-AZ architecture out of the box.  
- **Networking as a Service**: Managed load balancers, CDN, peering, and private connectivity.

---

## 2. Logging & Observability

- **Native Tools**: CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Azure Monitor, or equivalent for telemetry.  
- **Integrated Tracing**: End-to-end request correlation across managed services.  
- **Export Flexibility**: APIs and streaming into SIEM/third-party observability tools.

## 3. High Availability & Resilience

- **Redundancy by Default**: HA storage, distributed databases, and regional failover.  
- **Service SLAs**: Uptime guarantees often at 99.9%+ for core services.  
- **Global Scale**: Content delivery networks for latency reduction.

## 4. Security & Compliance

- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Provider secures infra; customer secures workloads.  
- **Managed Identity**: IAM, roles, and policy enforcement.  
- **Certifications at Scale**: SOC, ISO, HIPAA, FedRAMP already covered for many services.

## 5. Customer-Facing Features

- **Self-Service Everything**: APIs, portals, and CLI for instant provisioning.  
- **Pay-As-You-Go**: Metered billing, with enterprise discounts via commitments.  
- **Native Integrations**: Storage, compute, analytics, AI/ML, and databases pre-integrated.

## 6. Provider Bottom Line

Cloud providers sell **speed, scale, and agility**. Customers choose cloud to avoid owning physical infrastructure, but trade-offs include **lock-in** and the need to master provider-native ecosystems.
